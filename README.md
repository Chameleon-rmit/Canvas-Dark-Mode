# Canvas-Dark-Mode
Userscript to add a dark mode to RMIT's Canvas

# Installation
It requires a userscript manager to be installed (my recommendation being https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

After that clicking on [this install link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chameleon-rmit/Canvas-Dark-Mode/master/RMIT%20Canvas%20Dark%20Mode.user.js) will install the userscript.

# Using
The userscript only has permission to run on rmit.instructure.com (the Canvas web app) and after installing it should work after refreshing the page.

There is a new button added to the top right of the Canvas app that will allow you to adjust the hue of the colours to your liking.
